    Make sure you included everything necessary in the issue form template and someone will get back with you soon.

    Please note, if the tiles are for a beta patch, they will not be merged immediately. If they are for a mod, as long as you defined what mod it's for, it can be merged properly in the correct branch.

# Labels is an object where:
# - keys are labels
# - values are objects of { include: [ pattern ], exclude: [ pattern ] }
#    - pattern must be a valid regex, and is applied globally to
#      title + description of issues and/or prs (see enabled config above)
#    - 'include' patterns will associate a label if any of these patterns match
#    - 'exclude' patterns will ignore this label if any of these patterns match
labels:
  'ATS':
    include:
      - '(?i)\b(ATS)|(American Truck)\b'
  'ETS2':
    include:
      - '(?i)\b(ETS2)|(Euro Truck)|(ETS)\b'
  'Promods':
    include:
      - '(?i)\bPromods\b'
